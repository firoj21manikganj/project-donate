        <p>With your help, we can respond to these disasters and save lives. Thanks to you, in the last year alone we
            were able to provide more than 2 million women, men and children in 10 different countries with humanitarian
            aid and disaster response. When you give, you help us with both immediate response and risk reduction
            activities.</p>
